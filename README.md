## ECG Heartbeat Categorization with Machine Learning
This project utilizes a machine learning model to analyze and categorize ECG heartbeat data. The model is trained on a heartbeat categorization dataset and is deployed on an AWS serverless architecture using FastAPI.

# Key Features:
- **Machine Learning Model:** Processes and categorizes ECG heartbeat data.
- **Dataset:** Utilizes a dedicated ECG heartbeat categorization dataset for training.
- **Deployment:** Implements a serverless architecture on AWS for efficient and scalable deployment with FastAPI.

**Important note:** I do not own the ECG Heartbeat ML Model; it is derived from a source on Kaggle, the owner of the model is George Youssef: https://www.kaggle.com/code/georgeyoussef1/ecg-heartbeat-random-forest-classifier
